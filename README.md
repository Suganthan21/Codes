# MC-IsingModel
Contains Monte Carlo code for Ising model in 2d. Relevant plots including measuring fluctutations, correlations and finite size scaling analysis are shown. Primary Reference : Newman, Barkema

# MD-Basics
Contains Molecular Dynamics code in NVE and NVT ensemble(using Anderson Thermostat). Velocity verlet algorithm and verlet lists are used. Primary Reference :  Frenkel and Smit

# Rheology-PostProcess
 Contains post processing package(serial) to handle LAMMPS dump files. The following are some of the features : building neighbour lists, computing pairwise potential(LJ, DPD, SRP), measuring space correlation, time correlation(averaged over all time origins), MSD, Overlap Functions, grouping atoms, computing thermodynamic quantities - temperature, pressure, ke, pe etc. It also contains the code to perform Swap Monte Carlo used in the preparation of amorphous samples.
